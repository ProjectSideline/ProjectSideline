Project Sideline  

Overview

Project Sideline is an administrative and communications tool for Football coaches.
It solves three key administrative problems for youth athletics team coaches. 
        Namely - 
* Provides team/and roster management services, allowing for easy player data and 
  calendar management.
* It provides a communications hub for the coach, his assistants,  the players and
  the parents, to facilitate the passing of information related to games, attendance
  and  player stats.
* Automates player snap counts.

These benefits significantly reduce the coaches administrative workload while providing
a single platform for administrative tasks and communication.
