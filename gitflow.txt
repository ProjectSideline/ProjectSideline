If you are confused about the git flow we are trying to use this is the place to be.

When working on a new FEATURE
  1) make a new branch from dev branch. git checkout -b <name your branch>



Merging dev into your branch
  1) This will allow you to have the most recent changes from the dev branch.
  2) git checkout dev
  3) git pull
  4) git checkout <your branch>
  5) git merge dev



Merging your branch into dev
  1) once your feature branch is working and you think its ready for dev
  2) before merging your code into dev you must have the most up to date version of dev
  3) git checkout dev
  4) git pull
  4) git merge --squash --commit <your branch name>
